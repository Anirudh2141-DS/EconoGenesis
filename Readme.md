DystopianEconomySim
Welcome to DystopianEconomySim — a fully autonomous, AI-assisted cryptocurrency economy simulator.

This system evolves entirely on its own:
It writes its own policies, votes on governance, enforces taxes, redistributes wealth, and occasionally collapses spectacularly.
All you can do is watch, study, and try to survive the turbulence.

🚀 Features
🧠 Smart Economic Agents: Traders, Hoarders, Gamblers, and Inactive Citizens, each with personalized strategies.

🎲 Dynamic Event Engine: Treasury hacks, market crashes, stimulus packages, unexpected wealth redistribution.

📜 Autonomous Policy Creation: AI generates new economic proposals without human intervention.

🗳️ User-Led Governance Voting: Wallets vote on policies based on self-interest and class behaviors.

📈 Real-Time Economic Dashboard: Visualize treasury health, user wealth, and inequality trends as they change.

🌐 Interactive Streamlit App: Instantly deployable to the web or usable locally.

🔥 Built for volatility: Expect growth, collapse, inflation, and everything in between.

🧪 Technologies Used
Python 3.10+

Streamlit — For building live web apps

Hugging Face Transformers — Local AI for policy generation

Pandas and Matplotlib — Data handling and visualization

Numpy — Statistical computations and inequality measures

💬 Project Motivation
This simulator was created to explore the mechanics of decentralized economic systems:
how agents behave, how governance evolves, and how instability emerges even in structured environments.

It also serves as a dynamic educational tool to visualize and understand economic principles like wealth distribution, inflation, and governance dynamics.

✨ Planned Future Upgrades
Smarter agent decision making (greed, fear, rationality modeling)

Predictive machine learning for economic collapse detection

Advanced market cycles: booms, bubbles, recessions

AI-generated newsfeeds narrating economic developments in real-time
